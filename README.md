## The aim & working mechanism of this module

This modules outputs a cookie management banner (nearly unstyled, that's up to you) with the possibility for the user to:
1. Accept all cookies
2. Accept only necessary cookies
3. Choose, which cookie categories the user wants to allow
    1. necessary 
    2. statistics
    3. external media
    4. marketing

After the user made his decision, script tags of these categories can be loaded subsequently.  
```<script type="optin" data-type="text/javascript" data-category="statistics" data-src="/path/to/your/script.js"></script>```  
or inline:  
```<script type="optin" data-type="text/javascript" data-category="statistics">console.log("Statistic Cookies are allowed!");</script>```  
Also other tags can be loaded that way, but this feature is not thoroughly tested yet:  
``<img type="optin" data-category="marketing" data-src="https://via.placeholder.com/300x300">``

## Textformatter
If you want the user to allow to change the cookie consent, use the following Textformatter:
```[[privacywire-choose-cookies]]```
